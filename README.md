## Summary of the assignment
### Approach
- My Approach to this assignment was to do an Address Book that I would've like to use my self. Not just accomplishing the minimum requirements, but being able to execute functional and concise code for dynamic 
API endpoints.

### Implemented Features
Features used on this project were:
- Axios to make HTTP request from the API.
- React Hooks
- .Map()
- Routing
- Shared data

### Given more time, what else I would've done? How long would that take me?
Given more time I would've added more details to the selected user. Such as:
- email
- location
- image

Also, add more CSS, bootstrap and a search bar to look for an specific user. 
- This additional features would've probably taken me about one day.
